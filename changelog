# --- BUGS ---

>>> BUG20241213-01 : OPEN
	
	In monitor mode, if not connected to any server, unable to quit (see zmq::poll).
	
>>> BUG20241214-01 : OPEN

	xscan takes special key combinations into account as characters, then pressing Enter
	results in an empty dialog.
	
>>> BUG20241214-02 : OPEN

	Background radio noise sound is not played continuously when recording. There is a
	small delay between first click sound and noise sound.		

# --- IMPROVEMENTS ---

>>> IMP20241214-01 : OPEN

	When copying a speaker, the current dialog node becomes "root". Could be the dialog
	node of the source speaker.

>>> IMP20241215-01 : OPEN

	In phrases.cfg, when using [] callbacks to another sentence, the callback must be
	defined before using it. We may load the cfg file with to passes to avoid this, loading
	first all sentences then replace the [] inside loaded sentences
